## Introduction
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Netflix Clone, a web development project focused on recreating the popular streaming platform's user interface and functionality. The project is built using JavaScript and utilizes modern frameworks and libraries to deliver an immersive user experience.

## Features
The Netflix Clone comes with several features inspired by the original platform. Some of the key features include:
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication and registration process to provide personalized recommendations and user profiles.
- **Movie and TV Show Browsing:** Users can browse through a vast collection of movies and TV shows, view details, and watch trailers.
- **Search Functionality:** A powerful search feature to find specific movies, TV shows, or genres.
- **Watchlist:** Users can add movies and TV shows to their watchlist for easy access.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
The project is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The major technologies utilized are:
- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language for the entire application.
- **React:** A popular front-end JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.
- **Firebase:** A backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform used for user authentication and database management.
- **CSS:** Styling language used to design and layout the user interface.
- **HTML:** Markup language for structuring the application's web pages.

This will start the development server, and you can access the Netflix Clone in your web browser by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
